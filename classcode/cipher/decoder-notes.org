* Make a 26-space vector with the real english letter frequencies
  
  freq = [.017,.044,.052,.032,.028,.04 etc.]
  freq[0] is the % 'a' appears in a sentence
  freq[1] is the % 'b' appears etc.

* write a distance formula function that works on 26 space vectors


* for each rotation of our encoded sentence:
  1. make a vector for that rotations frequenceis
  2. calc the distance between that and the freq vector (form above)

  the vector that's closet to freq is probably our decoded sentence.


example:

If our rotation was:  "aabbbcccce"
We have 10 letters
the vector for the above string is:
[.2, .3, .4, 0, .1, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0 etc up to 26 letters]

compare that with freq above and check to see if it's the closest.
